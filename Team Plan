# Introduction 

- we would like to be able to view the taxi vehicle journeys in NYC in a readable format of tables. 

- these tables can then be queried and used to create some data visualisations and data reports regarding the data we obtain.

- we want this process to be an automated process and simulate monthly batch process starting from feb 2019 till the current date

# Getting Started

technology required:
- visual studio code
- azure data storage
- azure data factory
- azure dev ops
- snowflake
- lucid chart
- databricks?

programming languages used:
- python
- SQL

- links to lucid chart to see schema/erd

# Build and Test

- first create an azure storage. this will be where the data we obtain from the website will be stored.

- create a python function which will create url links like the website and store them in a dictionary in a JSON file

- use the lookup activity and for each to go through the JSON file and use the url links to get the data from the website

- create stages and tables in snowflake where the data will populate the data.

- futher transformation of the data and cleaning will ensure data is good to be used in reports and in data visualisations.

- validating the data in snowflake

# Contribute

- efficiency of the azure pipeline
- alternate ways to retrieve data from website

# Daily stand up documentation

# Repos with code and other information
